# My very first web page

Welcome, this project was made as part of my Code Institute course. I made it for educational purposes; to demostrate certain things about how github/ gitpod work. It's contents include three pages with image links to the Wikipedia pages for various coding technologies. I was walked through the actual coding of the page, as part of the course.
